MAP-BIND is a macro that allows visual grouping of variables with
their corresponding values (not necessarily 1:1) in calls to mapping
operators when using an inline LAMBDA. It does so in a way that
automatically supports virtually every existing and future mapping
operator, all lambda keywords and FUNCALL/APPLY/MULTIPLE-VALUE-CALL
variations.
